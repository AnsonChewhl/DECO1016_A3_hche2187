              Eiffel Tower in Paris. Great cityscape views can be had from the observatory - if you don't mind that they
              don't include the tower itself. <br> </br> Standing 333 meters high in the center of Tokyo, Tokyo Tower is
              the world's tallest, self-supported steel tower and 3 meters taller than its model, the Eiffel Tower. <br>
              </br> At the base of the tower, you'll find a shopping complex called Foot Town, which features an array
              of international shops and restaurants. </p>

              and some historical sites of interest. <br> </br> Takeshita-dori is a 400-metre long street lined with
              fast food outlets, crepe stands, and fashion boutiques peddling everything from socks to stockings to
              corsets. Here, you can shop, eat, and experience a loud, colourful side of Japanese youth culture in
              Tokyo.</p>

            <p class="landmark-description">Meiji Shrine is a Shinto shrine in Shibuya, that is dedicated to the deified
              spirits of Emperor Meiji and his wife, Empress Shōken. The shrine does not contain the emperor's grave,
              which is located at Fushimi-momoyama, south of Kyoto. <br> </br> The shrine was completed and dedicated to
              the Emperor Meiji and the Empress Shoken in 1920, eight years after the passing of the emperor and six
              years after the passing of the empress. The shrine was destroyed during the Second World War but was
              rebuilt shortly thereafter. You can experience Janpanese culture and history here. </p>
